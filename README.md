# ASSIGNMENT 2: ALGORITHMIC ANALYSIS AND PEER CODE REVIEW

## Learning Goals
- Implement fundamental sorting and array algorithms with proper asymptotic analysis
- Apply rigorous complexity analysis using Big-O, Big-Theta, and Big-Omega notations for
  best/worst/average cases
- Conduct professional peer code review focusing on algorithmic efficiency and optimization
  opportunities
- Validate theoretical analysis through empirical measurements and identify performance bottlenecks
- Communicate findings via comprehensive analysis reports and maintain clean Git workflow
